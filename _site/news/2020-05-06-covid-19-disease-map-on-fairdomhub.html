<p>FAIRDOM helps to collect knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of COVID-19 
and established a project in FAIRDOMHub for the <strong>COVID-19 Disease Map</strong>: <a href="https://fairdomhub.org/projects/190">https://fairdomhub.org/projects/190</a>.</p>

<p>he COVID-19 Disease Map is an assembly of molecular interaction diagrams established based on literature evidence for virus-host 
interaction mechanisms specific to the SARS-CoV-2. In the project lists of contributors, 
data and computational models, and literature is shared.</p>

<p>FAIRDOMHub and the data management support for the COVID-19 disease map 
gets featured in Nature Scientific Data <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0477-8">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0477-8</a>.</p>
