Thursday, October 15th, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract of the talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remarkably it was only in 2016 that the ‘FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship’ 
appeared in Scientific Data. The paper was intended to launch a dialogue within the research and policy communities: 
to start a journey to wider accessibility and reusability of data and prepare for automation-readiness by supporting 
findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability for machines. 
Many of the authors (including myself) came from biomedical and associated communities. 
The paper succeeded in its aim, at least at the policy, enterprise and professional data infrastructure level. 
Whether FAIR has impacted the researcher at the bench or bedside is open to doubt. 
It certainly inspired a great deal of activity, many projects, a lot of positioning of interests and infrastructure 
initiatives such as FAIRDOM. COVID has injected impetus and urgency to the FAIR cause (good), highlighted its 
politicisation (not so good) and the need to reassure communities that FAIR for health related data is not a 
contradiction with data privacy. In this talk I’ll reflect on how we are faring with FAIR: as one of the original 
authors; as a FAIR infrastructure developer for the biomedical sector and as a veteran of FAIR before we had the principles.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Carole Goble is giving a keynote talk about “Faring with FAIR” at the GMDS Workshop “FAIRe Data Infrastructures” on Thursday, October 15th, 2020.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">ELIXIR Training ‘Best practices in research data management and stewardship’</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/news/2020-09-09-elixir-training-best-practices-in-research-data-management-and-stewardship.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ELIXIR Training ‘Best practices in research data management and stewardship’" /><published>2020-09-09T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-09-09T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/news/elixir-training-best-practices-in-research-data-management-and-stewardship</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/news/2020-09-09-elixir-training-best-practices-in-research-data-management-and-stewardship.html">&lt;p&gt;FAIRDOMHub is presented at the ELIXIR Training “Best practices in research data management and stewardship” by FAIRDOM team member Olga Krebs.&lt;/p&gt;

which includes a few bug fixes since the last release last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, it fixes a validation problem with linking to Publications that were added before describing 
Publication types were available, and do not have a specific type defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details about the changes can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.seek4science.org/tech/releases/#version-1102&quot;&gt;1.10.2 Release Notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version includes the following enhancements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ability to select invididual terms that will appear within the dropdown list. The previous behaviour forced all subclasses or instances. From the list of terms at the bottom right, multiple terms can be selected by holding down CTRL, or SHIFT to select a range. By default all are selected. Many thanks to Andreas Weidemann for this contribution.
Tooltips are shown to display the term URI when browsing the ontology or selecting terms – this is to help resolves ambiguities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increased the default JVM to 1Gb, and increased the timeout limit when loading ontologies. This provides support for larger ontologies.
Please bear in mind, that for some ontologies you may need to be patient for them to load. For example the EFO ontology can take 2-3 minutes on my laptop.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An upgrade of all dependencies, and Apache POI in particular.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The third day SABIO-RK is used as a resource for kinetic data and FAIRDOMHub/SEEK is introduced as a data and model management platform fitted to the needs of systems biologists. The hands on exercises throughout the three days will ensure that attendees become familiar with the software tools and with analyzing, creating, editing, importing, simulating and storing biochemical networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This minor release contains some bugfixes and small improvements, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rails upgrade to the latest Rails 5 release (5.2.4.3), along with some other dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discussion links now have an optional label, to be displayed instead of the raw URL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discussion links are now included in the API&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Model organism has been included in the API&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Model image link has been included in the API&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An improvement to how Submitter and Other creators are displayed, to be less ambiguous&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Request resource has now been entirely replaced by the improved ability to request contact&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A fix to a bug that prevented Assays and Assets being unlinked, if there was only 1 Assay&lt;/li&gt;
