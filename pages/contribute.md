## Partner with Us

 FAIRDOM is broadening its community reach. We are looking to generate partnerships with both Collaborators and Facilities. 
 Collaborators can partner with FAIRDOM through formal arrangements such as joint grant proposals, 
 or through informal arrangements agreed between FAIRDOM and the partner.
